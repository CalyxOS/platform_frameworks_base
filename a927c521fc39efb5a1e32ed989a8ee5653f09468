It\u0027s a minimum of 5 seconds. (That happens to match up with KEYGUARD_LOCK_AFTER_DELAY_DEFAULT.)\n\u003e \n\u003e Setting it to 7000 appropriately takes 7 seconds, so it\u0027s not like it\u0027s adding 5000 or ignoring the setting entirely.\n\u003e \n\u003e Might be something to do with the min/max logic above, but I can\u0027t immediately tell what.",

That\u0027s not how this should work.\n\u003e \n\u003e (It\u0027s not an issue in AOSP because they don\u0027t allow disjoint timeout settings the way this change is endeavoring to do, to allow having a separate lock for profiles to be less annoying for those who choose to be less annoyed.)",
