It\u0027s a minimum of 5 seconds. (That happens to match up with KEYGUARD_LOCK_AFTER_DELAY_DEFAULT.)\n\u003e \n\u003e Setting it to 7000 appropriately takes 7 seconds, so it\u0027s not like it\u0027s adding 5000 or ignoring the setting entirely.\n\u003e \n\u003e Might be something to do with the min/max logic above, but I can\u0027t immediately tell what.",
