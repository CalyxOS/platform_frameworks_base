      "message": "^ I want to clarify this though, for when it *is* revisited: the part of the firewall that determines that an app is currently using the VPN transport, as opposed to Wi-Fi or Mobile Data, is not functioning properly for *connected* split-tunnel VPNs (where the user only includes certain apps). The firewall thinks included apps are on Wi-Fi or Mobile Data instead, so they are blocked. You enable Wi-Fi or Mobile Data, and then they get online through the VPN.\n\nSimilarly, you can turn off VPN for a VPN-included app, and *only* have Wi-Fi or Mobile Data on, and the app will still get online. This is technically a leak, too, so this needs work.\n\nAlso to be clear, none of it happens if you include UID 1000 app (e.g. Dynamic System Updates), so affected users still have a workaround.",
