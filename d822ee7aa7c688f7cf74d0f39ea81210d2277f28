      "message": "As in previous patchsets, Launcher3 is not permitted to call `getUserInfo` due to `SecurityException: You either need MANAGE_USERS, CREATE_USERS, or QUERY_USERS permission to: query user`. As you can see, I tried some `Binder.clearCallingIdentity()` shenanigans as I\u0027ve seen done elsewhere in the framework, and calling `mService.getUserInfo` directly instead, and it didn\u0027t help at all. So right now, I\u0027m not exactly sure how to get the framework to allow itself to obtain this info on behalf of a calling app.",
