      "message": "The code seems fine for the intended purpose. I don\u0027t know how long was spent debugging this, but I can say that changing this kind of change feels quite risky unless it can really be constrained to broadcasting to a single app.  Did anyone ever manage to write a test case that reproduces the issue?  I think that\u0027s a worthwhile thing to put time into.",
