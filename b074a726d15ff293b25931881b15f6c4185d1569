      "message": "That\u0027s fair, but effectively, mScreenLocked is the same as mIsKeyguardShowing except that it also checks if it\u0027s a secure screen lock. mScreenLocked is AOSP code, and they base their own USB restriction decisions on that rather than on whether the keyguard is showing, and it has been that way going back to Android 9 if not earlier; they don\u0027t even have a variable for whether the keyguard is showing. That\u0027s ours.\n\nThere\u0027s probably a reason that we check whether the keyguard is showing, but there\u0027s no code comment, so I don\u0027t know what it is.",
