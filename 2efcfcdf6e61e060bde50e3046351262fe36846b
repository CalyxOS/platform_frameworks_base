      "message": "If the device\u0027s owner wants to pretend that a secondary user is actually their main user, e.g. if their phone is about to be examined by an unfriendly agent, this patch makes it a lot more obvious that the secondary user is *not* the main user by showing an End Session button on the lock screen (and in the power menu, but lock screen is even more obvious).\n\nThis could harm some CalyxOS users, so this should probably not be merged.",

However, there are other things (which are less obvious) which would give it away as well.\n\nHiding it for sure isn\u0027t really going to be possible, however going out of our way to make it easy to tell apart doesn\u0027t sound like the best thing to do either.\n\n:/",
