      "message": "Checked with @olivercscott@gmail.com - the thought was that there is a new aconfig flag that might replace the unported piece of this patch (seen [here](https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_frameworks_base/+/21775/10/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/PackageManagerService.java)).\n\nI can see the new AOSP code calls `crossUserSuspensionEnabledRo()`, which is tied to this (declared in `frameworks/base/core/java/android/app/admin/flags/flags.aconfig`):\n\n```\nflag {\n  name: \"cross_user_suspension_enabled_ro\"\n  namespace: \"enterprise\"\n  description: \"Allow holders of INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL to suspend apps in different users.\"\n  bug: \"263464464\"\n  is_fixed_read_only: true\n}\n```\n\nAs it says, though, and as we can see in the new code, this requires `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL`, not just `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS`, so we\u0027d need that. Not sure if that\u0027s too much to give to the launcher.",
