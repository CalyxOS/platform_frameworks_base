As far as I know, the app is started in a limited capacity anyway.\n\n(Separately, we should figure out a simple solution for users who want to ensure that apps aren\u0027t running without having the apps removed the apps from the launcher or homescreen like Hide does.)\n\n(This comment chain can potentially be Ack\u0027d)",
