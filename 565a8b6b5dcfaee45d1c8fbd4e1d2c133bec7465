      "message": "This looks like it blocks the verification if an app has any of the listed policies set - e.g. if the user blocks the app on mobile data, it will be blocked even if they\u0027re currently on Wi-Fi.\n\nSo, a couple of thoughts:\n1. Can we make this consider whether the UID is *actually* blocked?\n2. Can you break out conditionals of this scale so that they are easier to read, assigning them to a boolean that represents what they mean? For example, this one could be something like `val hasAnyRejectPolicy \u003d`?",
