User apps lacking the permission are added to the denylist right away. Now, system apps are not.\n- As part of above, do some refactoring to make the logic clearer.",

      "message": "Tested behavior of system apps by:\n1. Build and flash with the INTERNET permission missing for a system package (Contacts).\n2. Check toggles for app. They are disabled but on.\n3. Build and flash with the INTERNET permission added back.\n4. Check toggles for app. They are on.\n\nA naturally-occurring visual cue to this behavior (with this topic) is that when you install a user app without INTERNET permission, the toggles will be disabled-off, but system apps without INTERNET are disabled-on.",
